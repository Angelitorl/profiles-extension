## Fixes

### Black screen
---------
The black screen on the history page is caused by how I used to store episodes to fix this simply go to the [settings page](https://www.crunchyroll.com/account/preferences) on the left side you'll find an export and import section with buttons.
<p>
    Press the "Export History" button then press the "Import History" then select the history JSON file that was exported.
